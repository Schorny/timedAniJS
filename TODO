TODOs:
suppressTriggers() on Object and Composition
(and a reenable function of course)

every start(), trigger(), on(), off(), wait() function should be able to take array of events
especially startAndWaitFor()

we need a stop() function for animations or at least a requestCancel(callback)

add more Animation objects for GSAP, tween.js, etc.

split code up in modules

implemented build step to minify

objects registered to a composition should be targetable by composition/object:in
keep in mind this means they need to trigger the right stuff too once complete

Composition.unregister()

Object.destroy()

events should send info on what event it is. kind of like onRegex does.

create a describer for animations much like TATimelineDescriber to allow something like
d.delay(500, d.repeat(5, d.chain([d.velocity(), d.velocity()])));

implement a TimelineAnimation animation class
