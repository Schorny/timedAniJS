# TA.Timeline

*TA.Timeline* objects glue all together and are the core of what TA actually is.

A Timeline actually consists of two parts: the *TA.Timeline* itself and a *TA.TimelineDescriber* that helps you write the Timeline.

## TA.TimelineDescriber ([JSDoc](/external/doc/TA.TimelineDescriber.html))

To get a describer call `timeline.getDescriber();` on a *TA.Timeline* object. Keep in mind that each Timeline has its own Describer.
