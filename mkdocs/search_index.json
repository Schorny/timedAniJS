It does not itself provide you with the means of animation, you can and should use awesome Libraries like \njQuery.animate\n, \nvelocity.js\n, \nGSAP\n or the others.\n\n\nTA provides you with the means to clue different animations together using a simple timeline. Imagine you want to create an animation like the end credits in a movie: you have different logos, headlines and sublines that all appear after each other or simultaneously. It can be a real pain to write these animations in a way that changes can easily be done and tested. In TA you describe your animations, your objects you want to use and then clue them together in a timeline.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nvar tl = new TA.Timeline('timeline');\nvar d = tl.getDescriber();\ntl.add([\n  d.startAndWaitFor('headline:in'),\n  d.startAndWaitFor('subline1:in'),\n  d.delay(2000),\n  d.start('subline1:out'),\n  d.startAndWaitFor('subline2:in'),\n  d.delay(2000),\n  d.start('subline2:out'),\n  d.delay(500),\n  d.start('headline:out')\n]);\ntl.play();\n\n\n\n\nWe created a \nTA.Timeline\n and started and waited for completion of different animations. What these animations are and how they look like are of no concern to our timeline. The 'headline:in' animation might look like this:\n\n\nvar fadeIn = new TA.JQueryAnimation(\n  {opacity:1}, {duration:1000}\n);\n\n\n\n\nWe are using a simple \njQuery.animate\n call to do the animation to animate opacity to 1 over the duration of 1000 milliseconds.\n\n\nOf course we are still missing the object to animate. Imagine we have a \ndiv\n with the id 'headline' that contains our text.\n\n\nvar headline = new TA.Object(\n  'headline',\n  $('#headline'),\n  { in: fadeIn }\n);\n\n\n\n\nWe now have an object that knows how to fade itself 'in'.",
